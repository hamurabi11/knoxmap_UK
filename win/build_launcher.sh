# Build KnoxMap.exe, the launcher people double-click, with mingw-w64.
#
# The release builds it with MSVC instead (win/build_launcher.ps1),
# because antivirus heuristics treat a small mingw-built binary that
# spawns a process as the thing it structurally resembles. This is the
# same launcher from the same source, for building on Linux - and for
# anyone who would rather not need Visual Studio to check what ships.
#
#     sudo apt install gcc-mingw-w64-x86-64 binutils-mingw-w64-x86-64
#     win/build_launcher.sh [version]
#
# Writes KnoxMap.exe next to this repository's other files. It is not
# committed: the release workflow builds it and puts it in the Windows
# download only. See win/knoxmap_launcher.c for what it does.
